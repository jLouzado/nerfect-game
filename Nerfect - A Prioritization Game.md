# It's not all about the Framework
There's a lot of heated debate about which Prioritization framework is the "Best" (ICE, RICE, MoSCoW, etc) but not really any discussion about how that framework is actually operationalized:
1. How often are are new ideas given a score?
2. Who scores what terms in the formula, and how was that formula chosen?
3. How strictly should we be following the framework?

Without some answer to these questions, things quickly devolve into the dreaded [[Feature Factory]]. What follows is a kind of "Game" that the various stakeholders can play to give the Company the best chance of delivering Value to Customers.

# Objective
- Build the best possible Product for your Customers
- Leverage the best knowledge of everyone on the team
- Guard against any one particular stakeholder having too much influence.

# Player Personas
1. Founder
2. Technical Architect
3. UX / UI Designer
4. Domain-Expert / Stakeholder
5. Product Manager (Optional)

# Equipment
1. Project Management tool
	- ideally something that has labels and task types
	- must be able to add fields per Task
	- must be able to calculate a field based on the value of other fields
2. Version-control platform for the source-code
3. Optional:
	- DM platform (Slack, Whatsapp, etc), 
	- Documentation hub (Notion, Docs, etc), and 
	- Discussion space (Email, Mailing List, Forums, etc)

> Google sheets + Gitlab is more than sufficient FYI

# Setup
- Each Player chooses a Persona
- Create a `Backlog`; an empty list in your Project Management tool
- Host a brainstorming session and populate the Backlog with `Ideas`

[bk]
- different `Ideas` have different attributes for how good they are
- the different values are only visible to people on the team who know how to read those values
- there are various penalties and bonuses based on who people are

# Winning
Execute on your ideas and bring in revenue faster than your burn-rate

# Strategies
- [[Small Company, Egalitarian Culture]]
- [[Large Company, Autocratic Culture]]
